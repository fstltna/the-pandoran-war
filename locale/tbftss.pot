msgid "Patrol #1"
msgstr ""

msgid "With the Pandorans having invaded Independent systems boardering the Mitikas Empire, we need to become more vigilant. Patrols around Torelli are being stepped up. Ensure you hit all the waypoints, and report any unusual activity that you encounter."
msgstr ""

msgid "Check all waypoints"
msgstr ""

msgid "Anyone got anything to report?"
msgstr ""

msgid "You getting paranoid, Curtis?"
msgstr ""

msgid "You all saw what happened at Coyote."
msgstr ""

msgid "So, those Pandorans are, what, robots?"
msgstr ""

msgid "Alien-Human hybrid, I heard."
msgstr ""

msgid "Hard to kill, whatever they are. Heard they'll still be coming at you even if you take both arms off."
msgstr ""

msgid "And what'll they do then? Bite you to death?"
msgstr ""

msgid "Eyes open, lads."
msgstr ""

msgid "We're done. Anyone detect anything unusual?"
msgstr ""

msgid "Same old, same old."
msgstr ""

msgid "Believe me, that's a good thing. Right, let's head home and report in."
msgstr ""

msgid "Patrol #2"
msgstr ""

msgid "Patrols so far have not uncovered anything unusual, and it seems as though the increase in military presence is reducing the amount of illegal activity in this sector, with reported incidents down 80%%. Still, we cannot afford to become complacent, and must continue with our sweeps."
msgstr ""

msgid "Check all Waypoints"
msgstr ""

msgid "Destroy Pandoran fighters"
msgstr ""

msgid "Eightballers, you have hostiles incoming. Identified as 3 Mitikas fighters; Jackals, possibly Pandoran. Engage, but exercise extreme caution."
msgstr ""

msgid "Control, enemies have been dispatched. Wasn't a comfortable fight."
msgstr ""

msgid "Eightballers, return home immediately, and deliver a full report. Do not leave out a single detail."
msgstr ""

msgid "Got it. See you soon."
msgstr ""

msgid "Patrol #3"
msgstr ""

msgid "Following the devastating loss of the Iliad system, we need to continue to be vigilant against incursion into the Alba system. Check all five waypoints, and report immediate any unusual or suspicious activity you encounter."
msgstr ""

msgid "So, Iliad has fallen?"
msgstr ""

msgid "From what I've heard."
msgstr ""

msgid "Did they retreat, or ..."
msgstr ""

msgid "They fought to the very last."
msgstr ""

msgid "So that's it. The Pandorans have won?"
msgstr ""

msgid "At Iliad, yes. Unless the local forces there can somehow hold off the enemy's ground assault."
msgstr ""

msgid "It's ... possible, right?"
msgstr ""

msgid "The Pandorans will just nuke the place when they're done. They'll take what they need, kill everyone who stands in their way ..."
msgstr ""

msgid "And even those who don't."
msgstr ""

msgid "...and move on."
msgstr ""

msgid "You're quiet, Wade."
msgstr ""

msgid "Just thinking."
msgstr ""

msgid "What about?"
msgstr ""

msgid "How long it'll be before the Pandorans show up here."
msgstr ""

msgid "They came by earlier, in case you don't remember."
msgstr ""

msgid "And haven't been back since. Maybe we scared them off."
msgstr ""

msgid "I doubt it, guys. They were probably just scouting."
msgstr ""

msgid "Where the hell are the CSN? Why weren't they at Iliad?"
msgstr ""

msgid "They weren't wanted, apparently. Iliad and the UNF aren't getting along so well at the moment."
msgstr ""

msgid "Something to do with Adrian Parsons?"
msgstr ""

msgid "That bloody idiot? It wouldn't surprise me. He's the reason we're now in this mess! If I ever meet that guy, nothing'll stop me from-"
msgstr ""

msgid "Hey, mind what you say. All these communications are logged."
msgstr ""

msgid "(indecipherable muttering)"
msgstr ""

msgid "What do you mean, it's all Parsons' fault?"
msgstr ""

msgid "He made an executive decision over in Coyote several months ago, that screwed everything up. Something about being charged with a super weapon."
msgstr ""

msgid "Grendel's Mother?"
msgstr ""

msgid "No, something it was carrying. Linked to the ATAFs, apparently."
msgstr ""

msgid "The CSN built something that nuked a whole load of allied and Pandoran forces. It wasn't meant to be used in Coyote, though."
msgstr ""

msgid "You don't say."
msgstr ""

msgid "Okay, lads, let's wrap this topic up, eh?"
msgstr ""

msgid "That's it, all done. Anyone got anything to report?"
msgstr ""

msgid "Nothing."
msgstr ""

msgid "Nope."
msgstr ""

msgid "Okay, let's get home and report in."
msgstr ""

msgid "Alba Defence #1"
msgstr ""

msgid "A number of key Independent systems have come under simultaneous attack by Tzac forces. We need to drive them away, so that we can continue to focus on the more pressing threat of the Pandoran army. At this time, it is vital that we prevent Christabel from making any significant gains by amassing her forces in these locations."
msgstr ""

msgid "Defeat Tzac group #1"
msgstr ""

msgid "Defeat Tzac group #2"
msgstr ""

msgid "Defeat Tzac group #3"
msgstr ""

msgid "Three Tzac fighter groups has been sighted in the area. We need to hunt them down and eliminate them."
msgstr ""

msgid "Enemies sighted."
msgstr ""

msgid "Break and attack, people!"
msgstr ""

msgid "That's the first group handled. Let's get to the next waypoint."
msgstr ""

msgid "Second group located."
msgstr ""

msgid "Control, this is Rice. Nine enemy fighters downed. Moving to the final waypoint."
msgstr ""

msgid "Final group spotted."
msgstr ""

msgid "That's all of them."
msgstr ""

msgid "Not as tough as I was expecting."
msgstr ""

msgid "I think they're testing the water, like our Pandoran friends before them."
msgstr ""

msgid "We'd better prepare ourselves for a major attack in the next few days. Hopefully not from both of them at once."
msgstr ""

msgid "Alba Defence #2"
msgstr ""

msgid "Tzac forces are continuing to make aggressive moves against Alba. Its forces need to be driven back, and out of the system entirely. Naval power is starting to come under strain, and these continued assaults could leave us vulnerable to a Pandoran attack."
msgstr ""

msgid "Eliminate all enemy targets"
msgstr ""

msgid "Destroy HMS 821-283"
msgstr ""

msgid "Destroy INF Burnside"
msgstr ""

msgid "Break and attack, lads. Let's send these guys back home."
msgstr ""

msgid "More Tzac fighters incoming."
msgstr ""

msgid "Steel yourself, lads. Even more Tzac forces are heading our way."
msgstr ""

msgid "Picking up two capital ships, moving in."
msgstr ""

msgid "Wait, those aren't only Tzac forces ... "
msgstr ""

msgid "Ah, hell! Now we've got Pandorans, too?!"
msgstr ""

msgid "Commander, we're getting shot to ribbons here! We need to fallback!"
msgstr ""

msgid "We can't let EITHER of these two win! That would be a major loss for all of us."
msgstr ""

msgid "Eightballers, de Winter of the White Knights, here to assist."
msgstr ""

msgid "White Knights! Am I glad to see you. Your timing couldn't be better."
msgstr ""

msgid "I owe you my life, Knights."
msgstr ""

msgid "We're all in this together, Rice. I'm sorry we arrived too late to save your wingmates."
msgstr ""

msgid "They were good guys. They'll be missed."
msgstr ""

msgid "We're needed elsewhere. We'll see you soon."
msgstr ""

msgid "Traitor Hunt #2"
msgstr ""

msgid "While Trilliack is happy to arrest the traitors it brings in, Alba wishes to dole out swift punishment for their actions. Eliminate all enemy targets, with the exception of any fighters that surrender. Only those are to be brought in."
msgstr ""

msgid "Eliminate all traitors"
msgstr ""

msgid "Do not kill surrendering targets"
msgstr ""

msgid "Our orders are to destroy all opposing fighters, except any who surrender. They're to be magged, instead."
msgstr ""

msgid "One of them has surrendered. Mag him, ASAP."
msgstr ""

msgid "Another has thrown in the towel. Disable that fighter!"
msgstr ""

msgid "Four of them have now surrendered."
msgstr ""

msgid "I'd have been expecting more of them to have surrendered than this."
msgstr ""

msgid "Some are clearly braver than others."
msgstr ""

msgid "Or perhaps stupider."
msgstr ""

msgid "Good work, everyone. Control are sending tugs to bring these guys in."
msgstr ""

msgid "Think they'll get a long sentence?"
msgstr ""

msgid "Depends on how many capable pilots we can afford to keep shoving behind bars ..."
msgstr ""

msgid "Traitor Hunt #4"
msgstr ""

msgid "Roman Burgess, one of the masterminds behind the illicit arms and information smuggling to Tzac, has been located. Senior command want this man alive, so that he can be interrogated and lead us to the others. He must not under any circumstances be allowed to be killed."
msgstr ""

msgid "Capture Roman Burgess"
msgstr ""

msgid "Defeat Pandorans"
msgstr ""

msgid "Do not kill Roman Burgess"
msgstr ""

msgid "We need Burgess alive. The others should be destroyed unless they surrender."
msgstr ""

msgid "Strickland, the situation just escalated. A wing of Pandoran fighters just entered the area."
msgstr ""

msgid "Dammit! People, we need to keep those fighters away from Burgess. We can't lose that lead!"
msgstr ""

msgid "Where'd they get those Shales from?"
msgstr ""

msgid "From Christabel's ill-advised decision to attack the Enemy directly, no doubt."
msgstr ""

msgid "To hell with you! Christabel was our only hope of surviving this thing."
msgstr ""

msgid "Save it, buddy. You can spill it all at the court martial."
msgstr ""

msgid "Looks like that's it."
msgstr ""

msgid "Good flying today, Seth."
msgstr ""

msgid "Thank you. I'm just glad to have survived another day."
msgstr ""

msgid "We'll get through this. Neither of us are getting flagged before the end of this thing."
msgstr ""

msgid "Alba Defence #3"
msgstr ""

msgid "The Pandorans have begun moving forces into the system, and formed a number of staging grounds. Some of these grounds consist of Tzac fighters that have been acquired from Crystabel's forces. As of now, they are non-operational, but are being defended by some mobile plasma turrets. The objective is simple: destroy those fighters."
msgstr ""

msgid "Destroy acquired Tzac craft"
msgstr ""

msgid "Destroy HMS 381-222"
msgstr ""

msgid "Eliminate all opposition"
msgstr ""

msgid "Defend CSN Inca"
msgstr ""

msgid "Reapers, it appears that the opposition is heavier than previously expected. We're picking up a Tzac corvette."
msgstr ""

msgid "Got it. All fighters, we need Inca to survive this one. We can't afford to lose any more capital ships."
msgstr ""

msgid "Looks like there are some tugs trying to extract the Tzac fighters."
msgstr ""

msgid "I see them. Take them out before they can get away."
msgstr ""

msgid "Rice, we've got INF fighters incoming."
msgstr ""

msgid "Huh, I actually thought they'd have been here sooner. Prepare to engage."
msgstr ""

msgid "That's the staging ground taken care of. Now--"
msgstr ""

msgid "Rice, we've got a big problem: a very large number of Pandoran ships just arrived in the system. Torelli is being evacuated."
msgstr ""

msgid "Never enough, is it?"
msgstr ""

msgid "Alba Defence #4"
msgstr ""

msgid "With the Pandorans upping their aggression, we have taken steps to start evacuating the Alba system. Many civilians will be using craft incapable of forming of their jump points, and so will be reliant on the gates. We therefore must ensure that these gates remain functional, and that all Pandoran opposition is held back."
msgstr ""

msgid "Defend the Jumpgate"
msgstr ""

msgid "Eliminate all Pandoran opposition"
msgstr ""

msgid "Destroy INF Stiletto"
msgstr ""

msgid "Destroy INF BC-41"
msgstr ""

msgid "Taylor, get over to that gate as fast as you can, and prepare to defend it. Be advised: the Pandorans are now commanding, INF, UNF, and Tzac fighters."
msgstr ""

msgid "There are civilians in the area. What about them?"
msgstr ""

msgid "Their needs are secondary. If we lose that gate, no one's getting out of here."
msgstr ""

msgid "Taylor, the jumpgate is taking damage. You need to keep the Pandorans away from it!"
msgstr ""

msgid "Half the jumpgate's control nodes have been destroyed. We can't afford to lose that gate!"
msgstr ""

msgid "Taylor, a Pandoran corvette just jumped into the area. It's heading for the gate. You need to take it down."
msgstr ""

msgid "Taylor, another Pandoran corvette just arrived. Identifier is INF BC-41."
msgstr ""

msgid "Both corvettes are down."
msgstr ""

msgid "Excellent work, Taylor. Eliminate the remaining enemy fighters, and await further instructions."
msgstr ""

msgid "Area secure."
msgstr ""

msgid "How's the jumpgate looking?"
msgstr ""

msgid "Some damage, but it's still operational."
msgstr ""

msgid "Good work. Continue to guard the gate, and eliminate any incoming enemy threats."
msgstr ""

msgid "Got it."
msgstr ""

msgid "Alba Defence #5"
msgstr ""

msgid "The Pandorans are pressing home their advantage, and moving many of their capital ships up the field. They are presently closing in on Torelli, and will almost certainly begin a ground assault once within range. CSN Dragon is being used to clear their path to the planet, and while you're not going to engage the planet itself, we need to ensure the survival of our own capital ships as much as possible."
msgstr ""

msgid "Destroy all enemy targets"
msgstr ""

msgid "White Knights, Alba's defence line is collapsing. We need to take down Pandorans' capital ships, now!"
msgstr ""

msgid "Acknowledged. Chaz, we hit them with everything you've got."
msgstr ""

msgid "Dammit, down to two corvettes."
msgstr ""

msgid "Dragon is pushing through to Torelli. We need to drive it back."
msgstr ""

msgid "Another corvette lost. We're being overrun."
msgstr ""

msgid "You Knights want to actually do something? We're being slaughtered out here!"
msgstr ""

msgid "Ignore him, Estelle; don't get involved."
msgstr ""

msgid "That's all the corvettes down. We'll have to take on Dragon with fighters--"
msgstr ""

msgid "Dragon's powering it's anti-matter cannon. It's preparing to fire at UNF Lotan"
msgstr ""

msgid "Dragon's firing!"
msgstr ""

msgid "Dragon missed! Lotan managed to evade to attack!"
msgstr ""

msgid "It'll be a while before it can fire its main cannon again. This is our chance to--"
msgstr ""

msgid "The anti-matter ball is still going ... It's heading for Torelli."
msgstr ""

msgid "Impact in 10 seconds ..."
msgstr ""

msgid "5 Seconds ..."
msgstr ""

msgid "(Shouting)"
msgstr ""

msgid "Estelle, Torelli ..."
msgstr ""

msgid "Oh my God."
msgstr ""

msgid "What the hell just happened?!"
msgstr ""

msgid "The anti-matter ball must've exploded in the atmosphere, and ignited it."
msgstr ""

msgid "How ... how did the Pandorans know that would happen?!"
msgstr ""

msgid "I don't think they did; they just got lucky."
msgstr ""

msgid "And now they'll use that against every planet they come to."
msgstr ""

msgid "All forces, retreat immediately! Repeat: retreat immediately. White Knights, dock, and prepare for withdrawal."
msgstr ""

msgid "..."
msgstr ""

msgid "White Knights, please acknowledge."

msgid "Defend the jumpgate"
msgstr ""

msgid "Tzac fighers are moving in on the jumpgate. We need to stop them before they do any serious damage to it."
msgstr ""

msgid "Goddard, command of this operation will fall to you, if events lead to me being unable to participate fully."
msgstr ""

msgid "Picking up a second group of fighters, incoming."
msgstr ""

msgid "More fighters, inbound!"
msgstr ""

msgid "The jumpgate is taking damage!"
msgstr ""

msgid "Half the jumpgate's control nodes have been destroyed! We need to step up our efforts to defend it!"

msgid "Antomis Offence #1"
msgstr ""

msgid "With the mercenary threat seen off and Tzac's initial attacks thwarted, it's time to begin pushing back against Christabel's forces. We plan to capture a number of their commanders, to help build a better picture of the forces at Mace, before moving into the system. As always, mag the targets and do not allow them to be killed."

msgid "Squadron commanders disabled."
msgstr ""

msgid "Great work, everyone. We just need to wait for the tugs to arrive and bring these guys in."
msgstr ""

msgid "Commander, I'm reading incoming fighter signature: Darts."
msgstr ""

msgid "I'll bet my house those are mercenaries, and given that the relationship with Tzac didn't end amicably they're probably targetting the commanders. We can't afford to lose them."
msgstr ""

msgid "All Darts have been dispatched, Commander."
msgstr ""

Even so, they are quite often held back from deployment, acting as reserves to bulk up numbers. Angels are notable for being the first INF fighter to be equipped with mag cannons, and for being somewhat smaller than most of the nation's other fighters. Also of note is the appearance, the fighter sporting a purple colour scheme, as opposed to the reds of more recent INF craft."
msgstr ""

msgid "The Advanced Tactical Assault Fighter (ATAF) is the single most powerful single-seat starfighter in existence. Only five have so far been manufactured owing to their tremendous development costs (each one said to be on par with a carrier).

It is the spiritual successor to the TAF upon which a great deal of its design was based."
msgstr ""

msgid "Like many other heavy-class starfighters, the Blizzard relies on firepower to make up for its somewhat sluggish performance in battle.

msgstr ""

msgid "A relatively new starfighter, only introduced in the last seventeen years or so, the Firefly benefits from an overall reduction in manufacturing costs, while still maintaining the same defensive capabilities as other light-class fighters.

The fighter was greeted very positively when it was introduced and many hundreds were constructed exclusively for use by the UNF."

msgid "Of all the bombers that the CSN can offer, the Hammerhead is one of the most well known. Slow, but sure, the Hammerhead is packed to the gills with rockets, missiles and torpedoes, making it a formidable and dangerous opponent within a conflict zone. Escorted by a wing of TAFs or Rays, a Hammerhead need only get in to range of a target to unleash a volley of rockets that would prove truly devastating. Hammerheads feature two seats, one for the pilot and one to aid with targeting and handling armaments. It also has room for an optional rear gunner."

msgid "Originally developed in 2580, the Leopard was redesigned from the ground up, to act as the United Naval Forces primary heavy starfighter. It is more powerful than the Sphinx and Rook, but shares their inherent weaknesses, such as poor handling and sluggish engines. Aside from bombers, it is the only UNF fighter craft to feature two pilot seats. It is also the only fighter in existence to feature plasma cannons on the port and starboard sides, operated by the second pilot. Budget restrictions meant that a third frontal plasma cannon was replaced by a particle cannon."
msgstr ""

msgid "The Lynx was a latecomer to the UNF's spacecraft compliment, the organisation purchasing Hammerheads from the CSN and, on occasion, Khepris from the Kingdom of Tzac. Neither were desirable longterm solutions, and so the Lynx was developed to fill the gap in the navy's offerings. The bomber was heavily inspired by the Hammerhead, with the UNF having found success in the use of the CSN craft in the past, and wished to continue that way."

msgid "So called because of the likeness of its two upper struts to that of a praying mantis, this is one of the most well recognised starfighters in the INF.

As such, it follows a similar form factor, but differs in both its colour scheme (green, instead of white and blue) and armaments, being equipped with three rapid-fire particle cannons, instead of the Nymph's two plasma cannons. Tzac denied any involvement in the theft of the Nymph's construction details, attesting that it believed the design documents were for a new type of Dart, and as such were not governed by any sort of intergalactic trade secrets."

msgid "The SK-31 is a medium-class starfighter, built and deployed by the Kingdom of Tzac. Unlike the Razor and SK-34, the SK-31 is equipped with two laser cannons, to enable it to disrupt the shields of its target and make it easier to either destroy or disable. It is unknown what the SK in the fighter's name stands for, and whether or not the 31 refers to an iteration or other internal identifier."

msgid "The SK-34 is a medium-class starfighter, built and deployed by the Kingdom of Tzac. Though its exterior appearance is very different to the SK-31, it features similar internal specifications. Unlike the SK-31, however, it is equipped with Mag cannons, instead of lasers. As with the SK-34, it is unknown what the SK in the fighter's name stands for, and whether or not the 34 refers to an iteration or other internal identifier."

msgid "The Imperial Naval Forces answer to the Rook, the Sphinx is more heavily armed, but equally as fast and protected. Generally a single seated craft, the Sphinx can also accept a rear gunner, making it more difficult for opponents to tail it."

msgid "An all round, multi purpose, single-seat starfighter, the TAF is the most well known and highest produced starfighter within the CSN. Both lightly armoured and shielded, the TAF is easy to handle in the hands of a rookie and praised even by the most experienced of pilots. It makes up for its lack of armour, shielding and armaments by benefiting from good speeds and ease of manoeuvrability."

msgid "The Thunderhead evolved from an original concept design for a new bomber, of which it still shares some features (such as a generous supply of missiles and torpedo hardpoints). It is faster than the Scarab bombers, but a lot slower than the Sphinx. It is, however, better armoured and shielded than both. It is rarely seen on the field, as it is now considered old, costly to maintain and has in recent years been superseded by the Sphinx. Despite this, it remains a formidable opponent and its offensive measures means that it is able to take down light-class vessels with ease."
